# 📊 Student Result Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze student result data using Python and powerful data science libraries. It performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizes key performance metrics, and derives useful insights into academic performance trends.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload and clean student result data (CSV format)
- Analyze subject-wise and student-wise performance
- Visualize results using graphs and plots
- Detect performance trends (top performers, low scorers, etc.)
- Interactive insights using Jupyter Notebook
